It's a Firefox Extension for Gitlab that helps open new issues.
When installed, it accepts only the domain https://gitlab.com but it can by configured to point to your on-premise Gitlab instance, that can be configured on extension settings.

### How it works
After install the extension, open Gitlab through your domain like http://your-domain.com, go to New Issue where now you'll see Templete button on the side of Preview.
